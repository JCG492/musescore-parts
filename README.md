# My Sheet Music Repo
This is where I upload files of any sheet music that I make myself, rerrange, transpose, or transcribe.
## Layout
Each piece will be in a folder <TITLE> and the files about.md , <TITLE-ENSEMBLE>.mcsz , and <TITLE-ENSEMBLE>-Score_and_Parts.pdf .
- about.md will contain deatils about the piece such as the title, date of creation, composer, and if applicable, arranger.
- <TITLE-ENSEMBLE>-Score_and_Parts.pdf will contain the full score and individual parts.
- <TITLE-ENSEMBLE>.mcsz is the .mcsz file.
